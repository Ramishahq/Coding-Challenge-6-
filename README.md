# Coding-Challenge-6-
In this challenge, I will create a simple Employee Shift Management System for a small business. The system will track employee shifts, check their availability, and assign new shifts. I’ll also calculate the total hours each employee works in a week. By using objects and arrays, I’ll learn how to manage and manipulate shift data effectively.
